# Finger-detection
The main objective of this project is to create a virtual drawing board that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures without touching the screen or using any physical tools. The project uses computer vision and hand-tracking techniques to detect the user’s hand movements and convert them into virtual drawings on the screen
